<h1> My Experiences ‚ó°Ãà </h1>

<button onclick="document.location='Myhomepages.html'">Backtomyhomepage</button>

<p style="text-align: center;">Few experiences that I have been experienced in life ‚ù£</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> üå∑ In my life, there are new things I have learned since I am small until now. I have met various types of people,  I learned many things, faced difficult things, and many more. This life has taught me many things, but all I can do is wake up from that and be a better person.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> üå∑ I also have experience in Anxiety and Depressive Disorders. Unfortunately, my life is not perfect like others. This happens to me when Covid-19 cases increase, and I need to learn from home, Online Distance Learning (ODL). It is so hard for me since I have no one.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> üå∑ In secondary school, I joined various sports such as Badminton, Netball, Volleyball, and Marching. My team also won the first prize in the Marching competition and got a trophy. I was also a leader to the Scout's team and handled a few programs, especially the camping program.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> üå∑ Next, in University. I have experience handling the "Selangkah ke UiTM" program as a facilitator. I also got dean list awards starting from semester two until 4, and I hope this semester will be the same. Besides, I also have experience in UiTM English Debate, in semester 1. </p>
